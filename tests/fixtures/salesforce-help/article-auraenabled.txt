AuraEnabled Annotation | Apex Developer Guide

The @AuraEnabled annotation enables client-side and server-side access to an Apex controller method. Providing this annotation makes your methods available to your Lightning components (both Lightning web components and Aura components). Only methods with this annotation are exposed.

In API version 44.0 and later, you can improve runtime performance by caching method results on the client by using the annotation @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true). You can cache method results only for methods that retrieve data but don't modify it. Using this annotation eliminates the need to call setStorable() in JavaScript code on every action that calls the Apex method.

In API version 55.0 and later, you can use the annotation @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true scope='global') to enable Apex methods to be cached in a global cache.

Parameters:
- cacheable: Boolean - If true, method can be called from cacheable methods; must be static and cannot perform DML
- scope: String - API 55.0+: 'global' enables caching in global cache
- continuation: Boolean - If true, method returns Continuation object (for long-running callouts)

Restrictions:
- Methods must be public static
- cacheable=true: no DML, no @future/@queueable, no callouts
- API 55.0+: Overloads not allowed on methods annotated with @AuraEnabled
